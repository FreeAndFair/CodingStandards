# Free & Fair Coding Standards

This repository contains the source files and rendered versions of the multi-lanuage Free & Fair Coding Standards. The latest version is always available from [https://github.com/FreeAndFair/CodingStandards/releases/tag/latest](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/CodingStandards/releases/tag/latest).

Internally, we typically edit these coding standards on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). A read-only version of the Overleaf project is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zswcvbhxmrmd#c05626); team members with write access have direct access to the project through Overleaf. 

Pull requests against this repository will also be evaluated for incorporation into these standards; we will generate pull requests of our own for all major changes that we make internally as well, so as to maintain a history of such changes.

The languages currently included, or planned to be included, in the coding standards are (in alphabetical order):
